<h3>REMARKS.</h3>

<p>It is an honour to the morality of the present age,
that this most entertaining comedy is but seldom performed;
and never, except some new pantomime, or
other gaudy spectacle, be added, as an afterpiece, for
the attraction of an audience.</p>

<p>The well drawn characters, happy incidents, and
excellent dialogue, in "The Beaux Stratagem," are
but poor atonement for that unrestrained contempt
of principle which pervades every scene. Plays of
this kind are far more mischievous than those, which
preserve less appearance of delicacy. Every auditor
and reader shrinks from those crimes, which are recommended
in unseemly language, and from libertinism
united with coarse manners; but in adorning vice
with wit, and audacious rakes with the vivacity and
elegance of men of fashion, youth, at least, will be
decoyed into the snare of admiration.</p>

<p>Charmed with the spirit of Archer and Aimwell,
the reader may not, perhaps, immediately perceive,
that those two fine gentlemen are but arrant impostors;
and that the lively, though pitiable Mrs. Sullen,
is no other than a deliberate violator of her marriage
vow. Highly delighted with every character, he will
not, perhaps, at first observe, that all the wise and
witty persons of this comedy are knaves, and all the
honest people fools.</p>

<p>It is said, that this play was written in six weeks&mdash;it
is more surprising still, that it was written by a dying
man!</p>

<p>Farquhar was a gentleman of elegant person and
bewitching address, who, having experienced the vicissitudes
of life, as a man of fashion, an actor, a captain
in the army, an author, a lover, and a husband;
and having encountered bitter disappointment in some
of his adventures&mdash;though amply gratified by others&mdash;He,
at the age of twenty-nine, sunk into a dejection
of spirits and decline of health; and in this state, he
wrote the present drama.&mdash;It had only been acted a
night or two, when the author, in the midst of those
honours, which he derived from its brilliant reception&mdash;died.</p>

<p>As a proof that Farquhar was perfectly sensible of
his dangerous state, and that he regained cheerfulness as
his end approached, the following anecdote is told:&mdash;</p>

<p>The famed actress, Mrs. Oldfield, performed the
part of Mrs. Sullen, when the comedy was first produced;
and being highly interested in its success,
from the esteem she bore the author; when it drew
near the last rehearsal, she desired Wilkes, the actor,
to go to him, and represent&mdash;that she advised him to
make some alteration in the catastrophe of the piece;
for that she was apprehensive, the free manner in
which he had bestowed the hand of Mrs. Sullen upon
Archer, without first procuring a divorce from her
husband, would offend great part of the audience.
"Oh," replied Farquhar, gaily, when this message
was delivered to him, "tell her, I wish she was married
to me instead of Sullen; for then, without the
trouble of a divorce, I would give her my bond, that
she should be a widow within a few days."</p>

<p>In this allusion he was prophetic;&mdash;and the apparent
joy, with which he expected his dissolution,
may be accounted for on the supposition&mdash;that the
profligate characters, which he has pourtrayed in "The
Beaux Stratagem," were such as he had uniformly
met with in the world;&mdash;and he was rejoiced to leave
them all behind.</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Here! here! Why d'ye bawl so, father? d'ye
think we have no ears?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> You deserve to have none, you young minx:&mdash;The
company of the Warrington coach has stood
in the hall this hour, and nobody to show them to
their chambers.</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> And let them wait, father;&mdash;there's neither
red coat in the coach, nor footman behind it.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> But they threaten to go to another inn to-night.</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> That they dare not, for fear the coachman
should overturn them to-morrow&mdash;[<i>Ringing.</i>]
Coming! coming!&mdash;Here's the London coach arrived.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> This way, this way, gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Set down the things; go to the stable, and
see my horses well rubbed.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> I shall, sir.<span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> You're my landlord, I suppose?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Yes, sir, I'm old Will Boniface, pretty well
known upon this road, as the saying is.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> O, Mr. Boniface, your servant.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> O, sir,<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>what will your honour please to
drink, as the saying is?</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> I have heard your town of Litchfield much
famed for ale, I think: I'll taste that.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Sir, I have now in my cellar ten tun of the
best ale in Staffordshire; 'tis smooth as oil, sweet as
milk, clear as amber, and strong as brandy, and
will be just fourteen years old the fifth day of next
March.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> You are very exact, I find, in the age of your
ale.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> As punctual, sir, as I am in the age of my
children: I'll show you such ale<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Here, tapster,
broach number 1792, as the saying is:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Sir, you
shall taste my Anno Domini<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>I have lived in Litchfield,
man and boy, above eight and fifty years, and
I believe have not consumed eight and fifty ounces
of meat.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> At a meal, you mean, if one may guess your
sense by your bulk.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Not in my life, sir; I have fed purely upon
ale: I have eat my ale, drank my ale, and I always
sleep upon ale.</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Tapster</span>, <i>with a Tankard</i>.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Now, sir, you shall see: your worship's health: ha!
delicious, delicious<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>fancy it Burgundy, only fancy
it, and 'tis worth ten shillings a quart.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> [<i>Drinks.</i>] 'Tis confounded strong.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Strong! it must be so; or how would we be
strong that drink it?</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> And have you lived so long upon this ale,
landlord?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Eight and fifty years, upon my credit, sir; but
it killed my wife, poor woman, as the saying is.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> How came that to pass?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> I don't know how, sir; she would not let the
ale take its natural course, sir: she was for qualifying
it every now and then with a dram, as the saying is,
and an honest gentleman, that came this way from
Ireland, made her a present of a dozen bottles of
Usquebaugh<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>but the poor woman was never well
after; but, however, I was obliged to the gentleman,
you know.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Why, was it the Usquebaugh that killed
her?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> My Lady Bountiful said so&mdash;she, good lady,
did what could be done; she cured her of three tympanies,
but the fourth carried her off; but she's happy,
and I'm contented, as the saying is.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Who's that Lady Bountiful, you mentioned?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> 'Ods my life, sir, we'll drink her health.
[<i>Drinks.</i>] My Lady Bountiful is one of the best of women:
her last husband, Sir Charles Bountiful, left
her worth a thousand pounds a year; and I believe
she lays out one half on't in charitable uses, for the
good of her neighbours: she cures all disorders
incidental to men, women and children; in short, she
has cured more people in and about Litchfield within
ten years, than the doctors have killed in twenty, and
that's a bold word.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Has the lady been any other way useful in
her generation?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Yes, sir, she has a daughter by Sir Charles,
the finest woman in all our country, and the greatest
fortune: she has a son too by her first husband, 'Squire
Sullen, who married a fine lady from London t'other
day; if you please, sir, we'll drink his health.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> What sort of a man is he?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Why, sir, the man's well enough; says little,
thinks less, and does&mdash;nothing at all, 'faith: but he's
a man of great estate, and values nobody.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> A sportsman, I suppose?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Yes, sir, he's a man of pleasure; he plays
at whist, and smokes his pipe eight-and-forty hours
together sometimes.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> A fine sportsman truly! and married, you
say?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Ay, and to a curious woman, sir&mdash;but he's
a<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span> He wants it here, sir.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Pointing to his Forehead.</i></p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> He has it there, you mean.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> That's none of my business; he's my landlord,
and so a man, you know, would not<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>but I'cod
he's no better than&mdash;sir, my humble service to you.
[<i>Drinks.</i>] Though I value not a farthing what he can
do to me; I pay him his rent at quarter day; I have
a good running trade; I have but one daughter, and
I can give her&mdash;but no matter for that.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> You are very happy, Mr. Boniface; pray
what other company have you in town?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> A power of fine ladies; and then we have
the French Officers.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> O that's right, you have a good many of those
gentlemen: pray how do you like their company?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> So well, as the saying is, that I could wish we
had as many more of them; they are full of money,
and pay double for every thing they have; they know,
sir, that we paid good round taxes for the taking of
them, and so they are willing to reimburse us a little;
one of them lodges in my house.</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Archer</span>.
 </p>
</div>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Landlord, there are some French Gentlemen
below, that ask for you.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> I'll wait on them<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Does your master stay
long in town, as the saying is? <span class="ind1">&nbsp;</span>[<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Archer</span>.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> I can't tell, as the saying is.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Come from London?</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> No!</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Going to London, mayhap?</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> No!</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> An odd fellow this; [<i>Bar Bell rings.</i>] I beg
your worship's pardon, I'll wait on you in half a minute. <span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> The coast's clear, I see&mdash;Now, my dear Archer,
welcome to Litchfield!</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> I thank thee, my dear brother in iniquity.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Iniquity! pr'ythee, leave canting; you need
not change your style with your dress.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Don't mistake me, Aimwell, for 'tis still my
maxim, that there's no scandal like rags, nor any
crimes so shameful as poverty. Men must not be
poor; idleness is the root of all evil; the world's
wide enough, let them bustle; fortune has taken the
weak under her protection, but men of sense are left to
their industry.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Upon which topic we proceed, and, I think,
luckily hitherto: would not any man swear now, that
I am a man of quality, and you my servant, when, if
our intrinsic value were known<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Come, come, we are the men of intrinsic value,
who can strike our fortunes out of ourselves, whose
worth is independent of accidents in life, or revolutions
in government: we have heads to get money, and hearts
to spend it.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> As to our hearts, I grant ye, they are as willing
tits as any within twenty degrees; but I can have
no great opinion of our heads, from the service they
have done us hitherto, unless it be that they brought
us from London hither to Litchfield, made me a lord,
and you my servant.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> That's more than you could expect already,
but what money have we left?</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> But two hundred pounds.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> And our horses, clothes, rings, &amp;c. Why we
have very good fortunes now for moderate people;
and let me tell you, that this two hundred pounds,
with the experience that we are now masters of, is
a better estate than the ten thousand we have spent<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Our
friends indeed began to suspect that our
pockets were low, but we came off with flying colours,
showed no signs of want either in word or
deed.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Ay, and our going to Brussels was a good pretence
enough for our sudden disappearing; and, I warrant
you, our friends imagine, that we are gone a volunteering.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Why 'faith if this project fails, it must e'en
come to that. I am for venturing one of the hundreds,
if you will, upon this knight errantry; but in the case
it should fail, we'll reserve the other to carry us to
some counterscarp, where we may die as we lived, in
a blaze.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> With all my heart, and we have lived
justly, Archer; we can't say that we have spent our
fortunes, but that we have enjoyed them.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Right; so much pleasure for so much money;
we have had our pennyworths; and had I
millions, I would go to the same market again. O London,
London! well, we have had our share, and let us be
thankful: past pleasures, for aught I know, are best;
such we are sure of; those to come may disappoint
us, but you command for the day, and so I
submit:&mdash;At Nottingham, you know, I am to be
master.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> And at Lincoln, I again.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Then, at Norwich, I mount, which, I think,
shall be our last stage; for, if we fail there, we'll embark
for Holland, bid adieu to Venus, and welcome
Mars.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> A match&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Have you got any fish, or wild fowl?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> As for fish, truly, sir, we are an inland town,
and indifferently provided with fish, that's the truth
on't; but then for wild fowl!&mdash;We have a delicate
couple of rabbits.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Get me the rabbits fricasseed.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Fricasseed! Lard, sir, they'll eat much better

<p><i>Aim.</i> Here, landlord, the locks are sealed down,
both for your security and mine; it holds somewhat
above two hundred pounds; if you doubt it, I'll count
it to you after supper: But be sure you lay it where
I may have it at a minute's warning: for my affairs
are a little dubious at present; perhaps I may be gone
in half an hour, perhaps I may be your guest till the
best part of that be spent; and pray order your ostler
to keep my horses ready saddled: But one thing
above the rest I must beg, that you would let this

<p><i>Cher.</i> Money! all that money! why sure, father,
the gentleman comes to be chosen parliament man.
Who is he?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> I don't know what to make of him; he talks
of keeping his horses ready saddled, and of going, perhaps,
at a minute's warning; or of staying, perhaps,
till the best part of this be spent.</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Ay! ten to one, father, he's a highwayman.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> A highwayman! upon my life, girl, you have

<p><i>Bon.</i> What horses have they?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> The master rides upon a black.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> A black! ten to one the man upon the black
mare: and since he don't belong to our fraternity, we
may betray him with a safe conscience: I don't think
it lawful to harbour any rogues but my own. Lookye,
child, as the saying is, we must go cunningly to work;
proofs we must have; the gentleman's servant loves
drink; I'll ply him that way, and ten to one he loves
a wench; you must work him t'other way.</p>

<h3>ACT THE SECOND.</h3>
<h4>SCENE I.</h4>
<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent"><i>A Gallery in</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Bountiful's</span> <i>House</i>.</p>

 <p class="noindent">
 <span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Sullen</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dorinda</span> <i>meeting</i>.
 </p>
</div>

<p><i>Dor.</i> 'Morrow, my dear sister; are you for church
this morning?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> Any where to pray; for Heaven alone
can help me: but I think, Dorinda, there's no form
of prayer in the Liturgy against bad husbands.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> But there's a form of law at Doctors' Commons;
and I swear, sister Sullen, rather than see you
thus continually discontented, I would advise you to
apply to that: for besides the part that I bear in
your vexatious broils, as being sister to the husband,
and friend to the wife, your examples give me such
an impression of matrimony, that I shall be apt to
condemn my person to a long vacation all its life&mdash;But
supposing, madam, that you brought it to a case
of separation, what can you urge against your husband?
my brother is, first, the most constant man
alive.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> The most constant husband, I grant ye.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> He never sleeps from you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> No, he always sleeps with me.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> He allows you a maintenance suitable to
your quality.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> A maintenance! do you take me, madam,
for an hospital child, that I must sit down and
bless my benefactors, for meat, drink, and clothes?
As I take it, madam, I brought your brother ten thousand
pounds, out of which I might expect some pretty
things, called pleasures.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> You share in all the pleasures that the country
affords.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> Country pleasures! racks and torments!
dost think, child, that my limbs were made for leaping
of ditches, and clambering over stiles; or that my
parents, wisely foreseeing my future happiness in country
pleasures, had early instructed me in the rural accomplishments
of drinking fat ale, playing at whist, and
smoaking tobacco with my husband; and stilling rosemary
water, with the good old gentlewoman my mother-in-law?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> I'm sorry, madam, that it is not more in our
power to divert you; I could wish, indeed, that our
entertainments were a little more polite, or your taste
a little less refined; but pray, madam, how came the
poets and philosophers, that laboured so much in hunting
after pleasure, to place it at last in a country
life?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> Because they wanted money, child, to
find out the pleasures of the town: Did you ever hear
of a poet or philosopher worth ten thousand pounds?
if you can show me such a man, I'll lay you fifty
pounds you'll find him somewhere within the weekly
bills. Not that I disapprove rural pleasures, as the
poets have painted them in their landscapes; every
Phyllis has her Corydon, every murmuring stream,
and every flowery mead give fresh alarms to love<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Besides,
you'll find, their couples were never married:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>But
yonder, I see my Corydon, and a sweet
swain it is, Heaven knows&mdash;Come, Dorinda, don't be
angry, he's my husband, and your brother, and between
both, is he not a sad brute?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> I have nothing to say to your part of him;
you're the best judge.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> O sister, sister! if ever you marry,
beware of a sullen, silent sot, one that's always musing,
but never thinks&mdash;There's some diversion in a talking
blockhead; and since a woman must wear chains, I
would have the pleasure of hearing 'em rattle a little.&mdash;Now
you shall see; but take this by the way; he
came home this morning, at his usual hour of four,
waked me out of a sweet dream of something else, by
tumbling over the tea-table, which he broke all to
pieces; after his man and he has rolled about the
room like sick passengers in a storm, he comes flounce
into bed, dead as a salmon into a fishmonger's basket;
his feet cold as ice, his breath hot as a furnace, and
his hands and his face as greasy as his flannel night-cap<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Oh
matrimony! matrimony!<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>He tosses
up the clothes with a barbarous swing over his shoulders,
disorders the whole economy of my bed, and
my whole night's comfort is the tuneable serenade of
that wakeful nightingale, his nose.<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>O the pleasure
of counting the melancholy clock by a snoring
husband!<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>But now, sister, you shall see how
handsomely, being a well-bred man, he will beg my
pardon.</p>

out the venison pasty, and a tankard of strong
beer upon the hall table, I'll go to breakfast. <span class="ex">[<i>Going.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Stay, stay, brother, you shan't get off so; you
were very naught last night, and must make your wife
reparation: come, come, brother, won't you ask pardon?</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> For what?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> For being drunk last night.</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> I can afford it, can't I?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> But I can't, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> What is the reason, sir, that you use me
thus inhumanly?</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> Scrub!</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Sir!</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> Get things ready to shave my head. <span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> Have a care of coming near his temples,
Scrub, for fear you meet something there that may
turn the edge of your razor. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Scrub</span>.] Inveterate
stupidity! did you ever know so hard, so obstinate
a spleen as his? O sister, sister! I shall never
have good of the beast till I get him to town; London,
dear London, is the place for managing and breaking
a husband.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> And has not a husband the same opportunities
there for humbling a wife?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> No, no, child; 'tis a standing maxim in
conjugal discipline, that when a man would enslave
his wife, he hurries her into the country; and when
a lady would be arbitrary with her husband, she
wheedles her booby up to town<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>A man dare not
play the tyrant in London, because there are so many
examples to encourage the subject to rebel, O Dorinda,
Dorinda! a fine woman may do any thing in
London: On my conscience, she may raise an army
of forty thousand men.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> I fancy, sister, you have a mind to be trying
your power that way here in Litchfield; you have
drawn the French Count to your colours already.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> The French are a people that can't live
without their gallantries.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> And some English that I know, sister, are
not averse to such amusements.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> Well, sister, since the truth must out, it
may do as well now as hereafter; I think, one way
to rouse my lethargic, sottish, husband, is to give him
a rival; security begets negligence in all people, and
men must be alarmed to make them alert in their duty;
women are like pictures, of no value in the hands of
a fool, till he hears men of sense bid high for the purchase.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> This might do, sister, if my brother's understanding
were to be convinced into a passion for you;
but, I believe, there's a natural aversion on his side;
and I fancy, sister, that you don't come much behind
him, if you dealt fairly.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> I own it; we are united contradictions,
fire and water. But I could be contented, with a
great many other wives, to humour the censorious
vulgar, and give the world an appearance of living
well with my husband, could I bring him but to dissemble
a little kindness, to keep me in countenance.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> But how do you know, sister, but that instead
of rousing your husband by this artifice to a counterfeit
kindness, he should awake in a real fury?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> Let him:&mdash;If I can't entice him to the
one, I would provoke him to the other.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> But how must I behave myself between ye?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> You must assist me.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> What, against my own brother!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> He is but your half brother, and I'm
your entire friend: If I go a step beyond the
bounds of honour, leave me; till then, I expect you
should go along with me in every thing; while I
trust my honour in your hands, you may trust your
brother's in mine&mdash;The Count is to dine <ins title="original has her">here</ins> to-day.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> 'Tis a strange thing, sister, that I can't like
that man.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> You like nothing; your time is not
come; love and death have their fatalities, and strike
home one time or other:&mdash;You'll pay for all one day,
I warrant ye&mdash;But come, my lady's tea is ready, and
'tis almost church time. <span class="ex">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Aimwell</span>, <i>dressed, and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Archer</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Aim.</i> And was she the daughter of the house?</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> The Landlord is so blind as to think so; but,
I dare swear, she has better blood in her veins.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Why dost think so?</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Because the baggage has a pert <i>je-ne-s&ccedil;ai-quoi</i>;
she reads plays, keeps a monkey, and is troubled
with vapours.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> By which discoveries, I guess that you know
more of her.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Not yet, 'faith: the lady gives herself airs,
forsooth; nothing under a gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Let me take her in hand.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Say one word more o'that, and I'll declare
myself, spoil your sport there, and every where else:
lookye, Aimwell, every man in his own sphere.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Right; and therefore you must pimp for your
master.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> In the usual forms, good sir, after I have
served myself.&mdash;But to our business&mdash;You are so well
dressed, Tom, and make so handsome a figure, that
I fancy you may do execution in a country church;
the exterior part strikes first, and you're in the right
to make that impression favourable.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> There's something in that which may turn to
advantage: the appearance of a stranger in a country
church draws as many gazers as a blazing star; no
sooner he comes into the cathedral, but a train of
whispers runs buzzing round the congregation in a
moment:&mdash;Who is he? whence comes he? do you
know him?&mdash;Then I, sir, tip the verger half a
crown; he pockets the simony, and inducts me into
the best pew in the church; I pull out my snuff-box,
turn myself round, bow to the Bishop or the Dean,
if he be the commanding officer; single out a beauty,
rivet both my eyes to hers, set my nose a-bleeding
by the strength of imagination, and show the whole
church my concern, by my endeavouring to hide
it: after the sermon, the whole town gives me to her
for a lover; and, by persuading the lady that I am
dying for her, the tables are turned, and she, in good
earnest, falls in love with me.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> There's nothing in this, Tom, without a precedent;
but, instead of riveting your eyes to a beauty,
try to fix them upon a fortune; that's our business
at present.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Pshaw! no woman can be a beauty without
a fortune.&mdash;Let me alone for a marksman.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Tom!</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Ay!</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> When were you at church before, pray?</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Um&mdash;I was there at the coronation.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> And how can you expect a blessing by going
to church now?</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Blessing? nay, Frank, I ask but for a wife! <span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

necklace, which the lady hid in the privatest

watch I took from a pawnbroker's wife; it was left in
her hands by a person of quality; there's the arms
upon the case.</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> But who had you the money from?</p>

<p><i>Gib.</i> Ah! poor woman! I pitied her&mdash;from a poor
lady, just eloped from her husband; she had made up
her cargo, and was bound for Ireland, as hard as she
could drive: she told me of her husband's barbarous
usage, and so, faith, I left her half a crown. But
I had almost forgot, my dear Cherry; I have a present
for you.</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Gone, and Martin here! I hope he did not

my own, because I would oblige him to love me.
[<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Mr. Martin, who was that man with my

<p><i>Arch.</i> Come, my dear, have you conned over the
catechism I taught you last night?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Come, question me.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> What is love?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Love is I know not what, it comes I know
not how, and goes I know not when.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Very well, an apt scholar. [<i>Chucks her under
the Chin.</i>] Where does love enter?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Into the eyes.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> And where go out?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> I won't tell you.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> What are the objects of that passion?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Youth, beauty, and clean linen.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> The reason?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> The two first are fashionable in nature, and
the third at court.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> That's my dear&mdash;What are the signs and tokens
of that passion?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> A stealing look, a stammering tongue, words
improbable, designs impossible, and actions impracticable.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> That's my good child, kiss me.<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>What
must a lover do to obtain his mistress?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> He must adore the person that disdains him,
he must bribe the chambermaid that betrays him,
and court the footman that laughs at him!<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>He
must, he must<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Nay, child, I must whip you if you don't
mind your lesson; he must treat his<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> O! ay, he must treat his enemies with respect,
his friends with indifference, and all the world
with contempt; he must suffer much, and fear more;
he must desire much, and hope little; in short, he
must embrace his ruin, and throw himself away.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Had ever man so hopeful a pupil as mine?
Come, my dear, why is love called a riddle?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Because, being blind, he leads those that
see; and, though a child, he governs a man.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Mighty well&mdash;And why is love pictured
blind?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Because the painters, out of their weakness,
or privilege of their art, chose to hide those eyes they
could not draw.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> That's my dear little scholar, kiss me again.&mdash;And
why should love, that's a child, govern a man?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Because that a child is the end of love.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> And so ends love's catechism<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>And now,
my dear, we'll go in, and make my master's bed.</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Hold, hold, Mr. Martin<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>You have taken
a great deal of pains to instruct me, and what d'ye
think I have learned by it?</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> That your discourse and your habit are contradictions,
and it would be nonsense in me to believe
you a footman any longer.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> 'Oons, what a witch it is!</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Depend upon this, sir, nothing in that garb
shall ever tempt me; for, though I was born to servitude,
I hate it:&mdash;Own your condition, swear you
love me, and then<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> And then we shall go make my master's bed?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> You must know, then, that I am born a gentleman,
my education was liberal; but I went to
London a younger brother, fell into the hands of
sharpers, who stripped me of my money; my friends
disowned me, and now my necessity brings me to
what you see.</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Then take my hand&mdash;promise to marry me
before you sleep, and I'll make you master of two
thousand pounds.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> How!</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Two thousand pounds, that I have this
minute in my own custody; so throw off your livery
this instant, and I'll go find a parson.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> What said you? A parson!</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> What! do you scruple?</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Scruple! No, no, but&mdash;two thousand pounds,
you say?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> And better.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> 'Sdeath, what shall I do?&mdash;But harkye, child,
what need you make me master of yourself and money,
when you may have the same pleasure out of me,
and still keep your fortune in your own hands?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Then you won't marry me?</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> I would marry you, but<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> O, sweet sir, I'm your humble servant; you're
fairly caught: Would you persuade me that any gentleman,
who could bear the scandal of wearing a
livery, would refuse two thousand pounds, let the
condition be what it would?&mdash;No, no, sir; but I hope
you'll pardon the freedom I have taken, since it was
only to inform myself of the respect that I ought to
pay you. <span class="ex">[<i>Going.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Fairly bit, by Jupiter!&mdash;Hold, hold! And
have you actually two thousand pounds?</p>

<p><i>Cher.</i> Sir, I have my secrets as well as you&mdash;when
you please to be more open, I shall be more free; and,
be assured, that I have discoveries that will match
yours, be they what they will.&mdash;In the mean while,
be satisfied that no discovery I make shall ever hurt
you; but beware of my father<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> So&mdash;we're like to have as many adventures in

die when the money were spent, egad, one would
marry her; but the fortune may go off in a year or
two, and the wife may live&mdash;Lord knows how long!
then an innkeeper's daughter; ay, that's the devil&mdash;there
my pride brings me off.</p>

 </p>
</div>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> Ha! ha! ha! my dear sister, let me embrace
thee: now we are friends indeed; for I shall
have a secret of yours, as a pledge for mine.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> But do you think that I am so weak as to fall
in love with a fellow at first sight?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> Pshaw! now you spoil all; why should
not we be as free in our friendships as the men? I
warrant you, the gentleman has got to his confidant
already, has avowed his passion, toasted your health,
and called you ten thousand angels.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Your hand, sister, I an't well.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> So&mdash;come, child, up with it&mdash;hem a
little&mdash;so&mdash;now, tell me, don't you like the gentleman
that we saw at church just now?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> The man's well enough.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> Well enough! Is he not a demigod, a
Narcissus, a star, the man i'the moon?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> O, sister, I'm extremely ill.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> Come, unbosom yourself&mdash;the man is
perfectly a pretty fellow; I saw him when he first
came into church.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> I saw him too, sister, and with an air that
shone, methought, like rays about his person.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> Well said, up with it.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> No forward coquette behaviour, no airs to set
himself off, no studied looks nor artful posture,&mdash;but
nature did it all.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> Better and better<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>One touch more;
come&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> But, then his looks&mdash;Did you observe his
eyes?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> Yes, yes, I did&mdash;his eyes; well, what of
his eyes?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Sprightly, but not wandering; they seemed to
view, but never gazed on any thing but me&mdash;and then
his looks so humble were, and yet so noble, that they
aimed to tell me, that he could with pride die at my
feet, though he scorned slavery any where else.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> The physic works purely&mdash;How d'ye
find yourself now, my dear?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Hem! much better, my dear.&mdash;O, here comes
our Mercury.&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Scrub</span>.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Well, Scrub, what news of the gentleman?</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Madam, I have brought you a whole packet
of news.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Open it quickly; come.</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> In the first place, I inquired who the gentleman
was? They told me he was a stranger. Secondly, I
asked, what the gentleman was? They answered and
said, that they never saw him before. Thirdly, I inquired,
what countryman he was? They replied, 'twas
more than they knew. Fourthly, I demanded, whence
he came? Their answer was, they could not tell. And,
fifthly, I asked, whither he went? And they replied,
they knew nothing of the matter.&mdash;And this is all I
could learn.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> But what do the people say? can't they
guess!</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Why, some think he's a spy; some guess he's
a mountebank; some say one thing, some another;&mdash;but,
for my own part, I believe he's a jesuit.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> A jesuit! Why a jesuit?</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Because he keeps his horses always ready
saddled, and his footman talks French!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> His footman!</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Ay; he and the Count's footman were jabbering
French, like two intriguing ducks in a mill-pond:
and, I believe, they talked of me, for they
laughed consumedly.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> What sort of livery has the footman?</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Livery! lord, madam, I took him for a captain,
he's so bedizened with lace: and then he has a
silver-headed cane dangling at his knuckles&mdash;he carries
his hands in his pockets, and walks just so&mdash;[<i>Walks
in a French Air.</i>] and has fine long hair, tied up in a
bag.<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Lord, madam, he's clear another sort of man
than I.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> That may easily be&mdash;But what shall we
do now, sister?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> I have it<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>This fellow has a world of simplicity,
and some cunning, the first hides the latter by
abundance<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Scrub.</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Madam.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> We have a great mind to know who this gentleman
is, only for our satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Yes, madam, it would be a satisfaction, no
doubt.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> You must go and get acquainted with his
footman, and invite him hither to drink a bottle of
your ale, because you are butler to-day.</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Yes, madam, I am butler every Sunday.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> O brave sister! o'my conscience, you
understand the mathematics already&mdash;'Tis the best
plot in the world;&mdash;your mother, you know, will be
gone to church, my spouse will be got to the alehouse,
with his scoundrels, and the house will be our own&mdash;so
we drop in by accident, and ask the fellow some
questions ourselves. In the country, you know, any
stranger is company, and we are glad to take up with
the butler in a country dance, and happy if he'll do
us the favour.</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Oh, madam! you wrong me: I never refused
your ladyship the favour in my life.</p>

<p><i>Gib.</i> In this house, sir.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> What! all?</p>

<p><i>Gib.</i> My company's but thin&mdash;Ha! ha! ha! we are
but three;&mdash;ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> You are merry, sir.</p>

<p><i>Gib.</i> Ay, sir, you must excuse me, sir, I understand
the world, especially the art of travelling: I don't care,
sir, for answering questions directly upon the road&mdash;for
I generally ride with a charge about me.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Three or four, I believe. <span class="ex">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Gib.</i> I am credibly informed, that there are highwaymen
upon this quarter&mdash;not, sir, that I could suspect
a gentleman of your figure&mdash;But, truly, sir, I
have got such a way of evasion upon the road, that I
don't care for speaking truth to any man.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Your caution may be necessary&mdash;Then, I
presume, you are no captain.</p>

<p><i>Gib.</i> Not I, sir; captain is a good travelling name,
and so I take it. It stops a great many foolish inquiries,
that are generally made about gentlemen that
travel;&mdash;it gives a man an air of something, and
makes the drawers obedient.&mdash;And, thus far, I am a
captain, and no farther.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> And, pray, sir, what is your true profession?</p>

<p><i>Gib.</i> O, sir, you must excuse me&mdash;upon my word,
sir, I don't think it safe to tell ye.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> There's another gentleman below, as the saying
is, that, hearing you were but two, would be glad
to make the third man, if you'd give him leave.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> What is he?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> A clergyman, as the saying is.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> A clergyman!&mdash;is he really a clergyman? or
is it only his travelling name, as my friend the captain
has it.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> O, sir, he's a priest, and chaplain to the French
officers in town.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Is he a Frenchman?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Yes, sir; born at Brussels.</p>

<p><i>Gib.</i> A Frenchman, and a priest! I won't be seen
in his company, sir;&mdash;I have a value for my reputation,
sir.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Nay, but, captain, since we are by ourselves&mdash;Can
he speak English, landlord?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Very well, sir; you may know him, as the
saying is, to be a foreigner by his accent, and that's
all.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Then he has been in England before?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Never, sir, but he's a master of languages, as
the saying is&mdash;he talks Latin; it does me good to hear
him talk Latin.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Then you understand Latin, Mr. Boniface?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Not I, sir, as the saying is;&mdash;but he talks it
so very fast, that I'm sure it must be good.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> No, no, we shall disturb the family<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>But
will you be sure to keep the secret?</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Pho! upon my honour, as I'm a gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> 'Tis enough<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>You must know then, that
my master is the Lord Viscount Aimwell: he fought
a duel t'other day in London, wounded his man so
dangerously, that he thinks fit to withdraw, till he
hears whether the gentleman's wounds be mortal or
not. He never was in this part of England before, so
he chose to retire to this place, that's all.</p>

<p><i>Gip.</i> And, that's enough for me. <span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> And where were you, when your master
fought?</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> We never know of our master's quarrels.</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> No! if our masters in the country here receive
a challenge, the first thing they do, is to tell
their wives; the wife tells the servants, the servants
alarm the tenants, and in half an hour, you shall
have the whole country up in arms.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> To hinder two men from doing what they
have no mind for.&mdash;But, if you should chance to talk
now of this business<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Talk! Ah, sir, had I not learned the knack
of holding my tongue, I had never lived so long in a
great family.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Ay, ay, to be sure, there are secrets in all
families.</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Secrets, O lud!<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>But I'll say no more&mdash;Come,
sit down, we'll make an end of our tankard:&mdash;Here<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> With all my heart; who knows but you and
I may come to be better acquainted, eh?<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Here's
your ladies' health&mdash;You have three, I think, and to
be sure there must be secrets among them?</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Secrets! ah, friend, friend! I wish I had a
friend.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Am not I your friend? Come, you and I
will be sworn brothers.</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Shall we?</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> From this minute&mdash;Give me a kiss<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>and
now, brother Scrub<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> And now, brother Martin, I will tell you a
secret, that will make your hair stand on end.&mdash;You
must know, that I am consumedly in love.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> That's a terrible secret, that's the truth on't.</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> That jade, Gipsey, that was with us just now
in the cellar, is the arrantest whore that ever wore a
petticoat, and I'm dying for love of her.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;are you in love with her
person or her virtue, brother Scrub?</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> I should like virtue best, because it is more
durable than beauty; for virtue holds good with some
women long and many a day after they have lost it.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> In the country, I grant ye, where no woman's
virtue is lost, till a bastard be found.</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Ay, could I bring her to a bastard, I should
have her all to myself; but I dare not put it upon
that lay, for fear of being sent for a soldier.&mdash;Pray,
brother, how do you gentlemen in London like that
same pressing act?</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Very ill, brother Scrub;<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>'Tis the worst
that ever was made for us;&mdash;formerly I remembered
the good days when we could dun our masters for our
wages, and if they refused to pay us, we could have a
warrant to carry them before a justice: but now if we
talk of eating, they have a warrant for us and carry
us before three justices.</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> And to be sure we go, if we talk of eating;
for the justices won't give their own servants a bad
example. Now this is my misfortune&mdash;I dare not
speak in the house, while that jade, Gipsey, dings about
like a fury<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>once I had the better end of the
staff.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> And how comes the change now?</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Why, the mother of all this mischief is a
priest.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> A priest!</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Ay, a damn'd son of a whore of Babylon,
that came over hither to say grace to the French officers,
and eat up our provisions&mdash;There's not a day
goes over his head without a dinner or supper in this
house.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> How came he so familiar in the family?</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Because he speaks English as if he had lived
here all his life, and tells lies as if he had been a traveller
from his cradle.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> And this priest, I'm afraid, has converted the
affection of your Gipsey.</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Converted! ay, and perverted, my dear
friend&mdash;for, I'm afraid he has made her a whore, and
a papist&mdash;but this is not all; there's the French count
and Mrs. Sullen, they're in the confederacy, and for
some private ends of their own too, to be sure.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> A very hopeful family yours, brother
Scrub; I suppose the maiden lady has her lover
too?</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Not that I know&mdash;She's the best of them,
that's the truth on't: but they take care to prevent
my curiosity, by giving me so much business, that I'm
a perfect slave&mdash;What d'ye think is my place in this
family?</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Butler, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Ah, lord help you&mdash;I'll tell you&mdash;Of a
Monday I drive the coach, of a Tuesday I drive the
plough, on Wednesday I follow the hounds, a Thursday
I dun the tenants, on Friday I go to market,
on Saturday I draw warrants, and a Sunday I draw
beer.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Ha! ha! ha! if variety be a pleasure in life,
you have enough on't, my dear brother<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>but what
ladies are those?</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Ours, ours; that upon the right hand is Mrs.
Sullen, and the other Mrs. Dorinda<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>don't mind
them, sit still, man<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> I have heard my brother talk of Lord
Aimwell, but they say that his brother is the finer
gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> That's impossible, sister.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> He's vastly rich, and very close, they
say.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> No matter for that; if I can creep into his
heart, I'll open his breast, I warrant him: I have heard
say, that people may be guessed at by the behaviour
of their servants; I could wish we might talk to that
fellow.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> So do I; for I think he's a very pretty
fellow; come this way, I'll throw out a lure for him
presently.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>They walk towards the opposite Side of the<br />

<p><i>Arch.</i> Corn, wine, and oil, indeed<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>but, I think
the wife has the greatest plenty of flesh and blood;
she should be my choice&mdash;Ay, ay, say you so&mdash;madam&mdash;your
ladyship's fan.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> O, sir, I thank you&mdash;What a handsome
bow the fellow made!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Bow! why I have known several footmen
come down from London, set up here for dancing
masters, and carry off the best fortunes in the
country.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] That project, for aught I know, had
been better than ours<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Brother Scrub, why don't
you introduce me?</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> Ladies, this is the strange gentleman's servant,
that you saw at church to-day: I understood he came
from London, and so I invited him to the cellar, that
he might show me the newest flourish in whetting
my knives.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> And I hope you have made much of him.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Oh, yes, madam, but the strength of your
ladyship's liquor is a little too potent for the constitution
of your humble servant.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> What, then you don't usually drink
ale?</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> No, madam, my constant drink is tea, or a
little wine and water; 'tis prescribed me by the physician,
for a remedy against the spleen&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Scrub.</i> O la! O la!&mdash;A footman have the spleen!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> I thought that distemper had been only
proper to people of quality.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Madam, like all other fashions, it wears out,
and so descends to their servants; though in a great
many of us, I believe it proceeds from some melancholy
particles in the blood, occasioned by the stagnation
of wages.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> How affectedly the fellow talks<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>How long,
pray, have you served your present master?</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Not long; my life has been mostly spent in
the service of the ladies.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> And pray, which service do you like
best?</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> Madam, the ladies pay best; the honour of
serving them is sufficient wages; there is a charm in
their looks, that delivers a pleasure with their commands,
and gives our duty the wings of inclination.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> That flight was above the pitch of a livery;
and, sir, would not you be satisfied to serve a
lady again?</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> As groom of the chambers, madam, but not
as a footman.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> I suppose you served as footman
before?</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> For that reason I would not serve in that
post again; for my memory is too weak for the load
of messages that the ladies lay upon their servants
in London: my Lady Howd'ye, the last mistress I
served, called me up one morning, and told me, Martin,
go to my Lady Allnight, with my humble service;
tell her, I was to wait on her ladyship yesterday, and
left word with Mrs. Rebecca, that the preliminaries
of the affair she knows of, are stopped till we know the
concurrence of the person that I know of; for which
there are circumstances wanting which we shall accommodate
at the old place; but that in the mean time
there is a person about her ladyship, that, from several
hints and surmises, was accessary at a certain time
to the disappointments that naturally attend things,
that to her knowledge are of more importance<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

friend, if your master be married,<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>I presume
you still serve a lady.</p>

<p><i>Arch.</i> No, madam, I take care never to come into
a married family; the commands of the master and
mistress are always so contrary, that 'tis impossible to
please both.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> There's a main point gained<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>My lord is
not married, I find. <span class="ex">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> I fancy, sister, he may be some gentleman, a

for his courage, fidelity, and discretion, to bear him
company in this dress, and who, ten to one, was his
second.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> It is so, it must be so, and it shall be so&mdash;for
I like him.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> What! better than the count?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> The count happened to be the most agreeable
man upon the place; and so I chose him to serve
me in my design upon my husband<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>But I should
like this fellow better in a design upon myself.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> But now, sister, for an interview with this
lord and this gentleman; how shall we bring that
about?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> Patience! you country ladies give no
quarter.&mdash;Lookye, Dorinda, if my Lord Aimwell

and there we must leave it<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>My business comes
now upon the tapis,<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Have you prepared your
brother?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Yes, yes.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> And how did he relish it?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> He said little, mumbled something to himself,
and promised to be guided by me: but here he

his distemper, and you must be the physician; put on

in the mean time with my lord's friend?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> You mistake me, sister&mdash;It happens with
us as among the men, the greatest talkers are the greatest
cowards; and there's a reason for it; those spirits
evaporate in prattle, which might do more mischief
if they took another course<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Though, to confess
the truth, I do love that fellow;&mdash;and if I met him

supernatural gifts;<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>I can't swear I could resist
the temptation<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>though I can safely promise to
avoid it; and that's as much as the best of us can do.

<p><i>Bon.</i> Ay, ay, Mr. Bagshot, as the saying is, knives
and forks, cups and cans, tumblers and tankards.&mdash;There's
one tankard, as the saying is, that's near upon

<p><i>Gib.</i> And I can assure you, friend, there's a great

<p><i>Sul.</i> The puppies left me asleep<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir C.</i> Well, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> Sir, I am an unfortunate man&mdash;I have three
thousand pounds a year, and I can't get a man to
drink a cup of ale with me.</p>

<p><i>Sir C.</i> That's very hard.</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> Ay, sir,&mdash;and unless you have pity upon me,
and smoke one pipe with me, I must e'en go home to
my wife, and I had rather go to the devil by half.</p>

<p><i>Sir C.</i> But I presume, sir, you won't see your wife
to-night, she'll be gone to bed<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>you don't use to
lie with your wife in that pickle.</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> What! not lie with my wife! Why, sir, do
you take me for an atheist, or a rake?</p>

<p><i>Sir C.</i> If you hate her, sir, I think you had better
lie from her.</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> I think so too, friend<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>but I am a justice
of peace, and must do nothing against the law.</p>

<p><i>Sir C.</i> Law! as I take it, Mr. Justice, nobody observes
law for law's sake, only for the good of those
for whom it was made.</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> But if the law orders me to send you to gaol,
you must lie there, my friend.</p>

<p><i>Sir C.</i> Not unless I commit a crime to deserve it.</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> A crime! oons, an't I married?</p>

<p><i>Sir C.</i> Nay, sir, if you call marriage a crime, you
must disown it for a law.</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> Eh!&mdash;I must be acquainted with you, sir,&mdash;but,
sir, I should be very glad to know the truth of
this matter.</p>

<p><i>Sir C.</i> Truth, sir, is a profound sea, and few there
be that dare wade deep enough to find out the bottom
on't. Besides, sir, I am afraid the line of your
understanding mayn't be long enough.</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> Lookye, sir, I have nothing to say to your
sea of truth; but if a good parcel of land can entitle
a man to a little truth, I have as much as any he in
the county.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> I never heard your worship, as the saying is,
talk so much before.</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> Because I never met with a man that I liked
before.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Pray, sir, as the saying is, let me ask you one
question: are not man and wife one flesh?</p>

<p><i>Sir C.</i> You and your wife, Mr. Guts, may be one
flesh, because you are nothing else<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>but rational
creatures have minds that must be united.</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> Minds!</p>

<p><i>Sir C.</i> Ay, minds, sir; don't you think that the
mind takes place of the body?</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> In some people.</p>

<p><i>Sir C.</i> Then the interest of the master must be consulted
before that of his servant.</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> Sir, you shall dine with me to-morrow<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Oons,
I always thought that we were naturally one.</p>

<p><i>Sir C.</i> Sir, I know that my two hands are naturally
one, because they love one another, kiss one
another, help one another in all the actions of life;
but I could not say so much if they were always at
cuffs.</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> Then 'tis plain that we are two.</p>

<p><i>Sir C.</i> Why don't you part with her, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> Will you take her, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir C.</i> With all my heart.</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> You shall have her to-morrow morning, and a
venison pasty into the bargain.</p>

<p><i>Sir C.</i> You'll let me have her fortune too?</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> Fortune! why, sir, I have no quarrel to her
fortune<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>I only hate the woman, sir, and none but
the woman shall go.</p>

taken nothing but what you might very well have

have.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sul.</i> The fellow looks as if he were broke out

my throat just now, because I would not deceive this

<p><i>Arch.</i> Ay, and I'll cut your throat still, if you
should deceive her now.</p>

<p><i>Aim.</i> That's what I expect; and to end the dispute,
the lady's fortune is twenty thousand pounds, we'll

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
